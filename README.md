# Overview

This program was meant to be a simple messaging interface between two people. I wanted to learn more about networking in order to in the future be able to 

write more networking programs. Networking is one of my new favorite areas of the programming world. It was exciting to learn about.

My program requires the server.py file to be run first, and then secondly the clien.py file. They will connect to each other and create a turn-based

command line messaging platform. I have not tested the connection between two computers on a lan, only between two files on the same computer.

# Network Communication

The network communication was a client-server connection, with no error catching or correction. Each message was only a text string and

was encoded into bytes before being sent. 

# Development Environment

I used two IDEs, Spyder was used for programming and runnning the server and Visual Studio was used for programming the client.

I used the python programming language using the socket and threading modules.
